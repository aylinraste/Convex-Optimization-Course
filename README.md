# Convex Optimization Course Projects and Homework

This repository contains the projects and homework assignments for the Convex Optimization course, based on the book *Convex Optimization* by Stephen Boyd and associated lecture slides. The course includes both theoretical and practical components to provide a comprehensive understanding of convex optimization concepts and techniques.

## Homework Assignments

### Theoretical Homework
1. **HW1**: Linear Algebra Preliminaries  
   Focus on fundamental linear algebra concepts that form the basis for convex optimization.

2. **HW2**: Chapter 2 of *Convex Optimization* by Boyd  
   Covers convex sets, their properties, and the essential groundwork for understanding convex analysis.

3. **HW3**: Chapter 3 of *Convex Optimization* by Boyd  
   Explores convex functions, their properties, and implications in optimization problems.

4. **HW4**: Chapter 4 of *Convex Optimization* by Boyd  
   Delves into convex optimization problems, including duality and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

5. **HW5**: Chapter 5 of *Convex Optimization* by Boyd  
   Focuses on duality theory, optimality conditions, and their applications in optimization problems.

### Practical Homework
1. **CHW01**:  
   Implementation of convex optimization problems using CVXPY, applying concepts from the theoretical assignments.

2. **CHW02**:  
   Advanced implementation tasks using CVXPY to solve real-world optimization problems.
